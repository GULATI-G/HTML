        <!-- Since the link we want to attach is in the same folder so we don't need to write 127.0.... 
        instead just write ./ and vs code will show the name of the file or else type that yourselves.
        Or by writing / instead of ./ we can go to the parent folder and link a file from there-->

    <!-- Insert Local Image -->
    <img src="./Img/sample.jpg" alt="My Image " width="400">
    <!-- src is the location of the image and alt is the text that will be dislayed in case the image
    doesn't load we can also fix the width and height. -->
